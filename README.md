jquery.lilCharacterCount
========================

A lightweight jQuery character countdown utility for maxlength text fields. The behavior is similar to Twitter's input field.

### Usage

Set the `maxlength` attribute on a textarea or text field, then call the function on the selector of your choice.

    $("textarea[maxlength]").lilCharacterCount();

### Options

There are no options. Set the character limit in the textarea/text input field's `maxlength` attribute. The class for the field not exceeding the character count follows the Bootstrap convention, `bg-success`. Exceeding character count is `bg-danger`.

### Copyright

None. Go nuts.
